1) Place all code files in whatever complier you use

If you have "letterinwords.ser" already, skip the following step
- Run Reader.java. This will save all of the words as boolean arrays, which is used to speed up the process

Run Gamer.java as this is the primary code, and follow all insturctions given by the computer
- Use all caps for letters
- Corridinates are (x,y) 1 indexed with y increasing as you go down (Ex: Center square is 8,8 ; bottom-right square is 15,15 ; middle-right sqaure is 15, 8)
- The words "Vertical" and "Horizontal" should be written exactly as typed
